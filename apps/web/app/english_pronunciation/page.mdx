# Vowels  

### Table of Contents

* A vowel is a kind of **speech sound** (Pronunciation)
* The sounds of english are written with(represented by) letters in the English alphabet, These sounds are divided into vowels、consonants ；
if the pronunciation (speech sound) a letter represents is vowel(s), then this letter is called a **vowel letter** .
* **Vowel** allow the air to flow freely, are produced with the mouth fairly open ,causing the chin to drop noticeably ; **all vowel** are voiced ; **consonant sounds** are produced by restricting the air flow( the jaw doesn’t drop noticeably)

* **Vowel letters** in alphabet: a, e, i, o ,u\
**Semivowels** : w、y are sometimes vowels, but sometimes aren’t
* All words in English have at least one **vowel sound** in them , so the words must have at least one **vowel letter** ( including y, m)
* **Monophthongs** are vowels that produced with the mouth in the same position from start to finish ; **Diphthongs** are vowels that prounced move from one mouth position to another ; **diphthongs** are actually two sounds

* Vowels differ by mouth shape  
“ee” is a **high front vowel** , “o” as in “got” is a **low back vowel**

## Consonants
* Approximants : “y”, “w”, “r”, “l”  are produced with less mouth constriction than other consonants, and in linguistics are called **approximants**.  
y vs ee : see/sea/me  
w vs ooh : moon/rule/grew
 
* **Stop Consonants** : `/t/`, `/d/`, `/p/`,`/ b/`,`/k/` ,`/g/` 
* **Continuous Consonants**: `/s/`, `/z/`, `/f/`,`/v/`, `/m/`, `/n/`,`/l/`,`/r/`,`/th/` 

* **Similar Consonants** : pronunciation are similar in position in the mouth(alveolar consonants)  

### /b/
* ...mb(words ending with mb) -> Silent b  
Plumber、Dumb、Climb、limb
### /t/
* (Beginning of the word) -> **True `/t/`**
* Beginning of stressed/emphasized sylables -> **True /t/**
* Consonant clusters(two consonants): street stop tree lift -> **True /t/** ?
* (Middle of word)`/…vowel + t + vowel…/` -> **Flap /t/**
* (Between words)`/…vowel+t/` + `/vowel…/` -> **Flap /t/**
* Consonant clusters(two consonants): street stop tree lift -> **Flap /t/** ?
* (End of a word) -> **Hold /t/**
* Between syllables and the second is consonant : / … t . consonant… / -> **Hell /t/**
* Glottalize /t/ -> Refer to **Glottal stop**
* /…consonant+t/ + /consonant…/ -> **Removed /t/**  
I slept badly last night  
You looked great  
Must be /mʌst/ + /bi/ = /mʌsbi/
* /… nt/ + /vowel…/ -> **Removed /t/**  
  went away /wɛnt/ + /ɜwei/ = /wɛnɜwei/
* /…consonant+t/ + /vowel…/ -> **Don't Remove /t/**
* /…consonant+t/ + /h…/ -> **Don't Remove /t/**
### /d/
* **Removed /d/** -> Refer to **Removed /t/**
* **Don't Remove /d/** -> Refer to **Don't Remove /t/**


### /l/
* Light L`/l/` :The /l/(sound) is light if it comes before the vowel or diphthong in the syllable ; so,it is usually at the beginning of a word/syllable
* Dark L`/ɫ/` :  If the /l/ comes after the vowel or diphthong in a syllable it is a dark L , When the L(spelling) is at the end of a word/syllable , it is called the **dark L**
* Silent L : L in alm , alk ,  alf is slient  
almond calm chalk palm half 
* Modal verbs : Oul , ol

## Producing consonants
* briefly stopping then releasing the air  
“p”, “b”, “t”, “d”, “k”, “g”
* diverting the airflow and associated resonance to your nose  
“m”, “n”, “ng”
* squeezing the air through a narrow space  
“th” as in “thin”, “th” as in “then”, “f”, “v”, “s”, “z”, “sh”, “zh” as in “vision”, “h”, and in posh dialects, “wh”)
* combining stopping then squeezing  
“ch”, “j”
* narrowing the vocal tract  
“w”, “y”, “r”, “l”


## Consonant to Consonant linking

- Same Consonants linking : One of the consonant is “deleted”, and the two words share one consonant ; specificilly , this is broken down into two situations : **same stop consonants linking** 、**same continuous consonants linking**
- **The same consonant linking** rule applies **within words** (compound nouns、words with prefixes and suffixes) ; Most of the time, **a double consonant** within a word is not held , but pronounced as one short consonant  
roommate , cattail , subbasement , unnamed , meanness
- For **Same stop consonants linking** , the sound is held for extra time, then released ; for **same continuous consonants** , hold the linked sound for slightly more time than a single sound .  
big game → big aim  
start time → star time  
same message → say message
- **Stop consonant to any other consonant linking** : Don’t release the first stop consonant , but hold it and then pronounce the next sound immediately .  
A brief stop is used to signal the final consonant of the first word  
eg. Cold tomorrow
* **Similar Consonants linking**:  
eg. We need to add some butter ,  
We need some… ,  
Let’t lay out
* **Assimilation** : When sounds come next to each other in a word or syllable, the sounds may change in order to become more similar to each other  
eg. Have to , Does she
- Two exceptions : Don’t link `/tʃ/` or `/dʒ/` sounds  
  Examples : each choice 、orange juice

## Consonant to Vowel linking
- You drop the consonant sound at the end of the first word. It’s like dropping the “pause” and treating the consonant as if the consonant belongs to the next word  
`/...consonant/` + `/vowel.../` -> `/…/` + `/consonant+vowel…/`

## Vowel to Vowel linking
* Smiley vowel linking :  `/...eɪ|i:|aɪ/` + `/any vowel.../` -> `/...j.../`  
pay all , the end , lie on
* Rounded vowel linking : `/...əʊ|u:/` + `/any vowel.../` -> `/...w.../`  
go out , too often
* Between smiley and rounded vowel : -> `/...r.../`

## Glottal stop
* **Glottal stop** :aka, **glottal plosive** , is a stop sound made by rapidly closing the vocal cords
* In English, glottal stops are often used in this way to reinforce a voiceless plosive at the end of a word
### Glottalized /t/
* **Glottalized /t/** is a variant of the /t/ sound between vowels and at the ends of words
- /…vowel+t/ + /…/
- /…l+t/ + /…/
- /…m+t/ + /…/
- /…n+t/ + /…/  
What did you say ? // Note the t in what

## Words Ending in “ed”
- “-ted/ded” = `/Id/`
- Voiceless Sound + “-ed” = `/t/`
- Voiced Sound + “-ed” = `/d/`

***
## Words Ending in “s”
- Voiceless Sound + “s” = `/...s/`
- Voiced Sound + “s” = `/...z/`
- s , z , ʃ , ʒ , ʧ , ʤ + “s” = `/...əz/` or `/...Iz/`
