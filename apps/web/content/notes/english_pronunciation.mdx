## Consonants
### /b/
- ...mb(words ending with mb) -> Silent b

  Plumber、Dumb、Climb、limb


### /t/

- (Beginning of the word) -> **True /t/**
- Beginning of stressed/emphasized sylables -> **True /t/**
- Consonant clusters(two consonants): street stop tree lift -> **True /t/** ?
- (Middle of word)/…vowel + t + vowel…/ -> **Flap /t/**
- (Between words)/…vowel+t/ + /vowel…/ -> **Flap /t/**
- Consonant clusters(two consonants): street stop tree lift -> **Flap /t/** ?
- (End of a word) -> **Hold /t/**
- Between syllables and the second is consonant : / … t . consonant… / -> **Hell /t/**
- Glottalize /t/ -> Refer to **Glottal stop**
- /…consonant+t/ + /consonant…/ -> **Removed /t/**

  I slept badly last night

  You looked great

  Must be  /mʌst/ + /bi/   = /mʌsbi/

- /… nt/ + /vowel…/ -> **Removed /t/**

  went away  /wɛnt/ + /ɜwei/  = /wɛnɜwei/
- /…consonant+t/ + /vowel…/ -> **Don't Remove /t/**
- /…consonant+t/ + /h…/ -> **Don't Remove /t/**



### /d/
- **Removed /d/** -> Refer to **Removed /t/**
- **Don't Remove /d/** -> Refer to **Don't Remove /t/**
## Linking
- **Stop Consonants** :  t, d, p, b, k, g
- **Continuous Consonants** : s, z, f, v, m, n, l, r, th
- **Similar Consonants** :pronunciation are similar in position in the mouth(alveolar consonants)
- **Assimilation** :When sounds come next to each other in a word or syllable, the sounds may change in order to become more similar to each other

  eg. Have to , Does she

### Consonant to Consonant linking
- **Same Consonants linking** : One of the consonant is “deleted”, and the two words share one consonant
- **The same consonant linking** rule applies **within words** (compound nouns、words with prefixes and suffixes).

  Most of the time, **a double consonant** within a word is not held,but pronounced as one short consonant

  Linking Within words : roommate , cattail , subbasement , unnamed , meanness

- **Same stop consonants linking**: The sound is held for extra time, then released ;

- **Same continuous consonants linking**: hold the linked sound for slightly more time than a single sound;

   big game → big aim

   start time → star time same

   message → say message

- **Stop consonant to any other consonant linking** : Don’t release the first stop consonant, but hold it and then pronounce the next sound immediately ; A brief stop is used to signal the final consonant of the first word

  eg. Cold tomorrow
- **Similar Consonants linking**: 

  eg. We need to add some butter , 

  We need some… , 

  Let’t lay out
- **Two exceptions** : Don’t link /tʃ/ or /dʒ/ sounds

  Examples : each choice 、orange juice
### Consonant to Vowel linking
- You drop the consonant sound at the end of the first word. It’s like dropping the “pause” and treating the consonant as if the consonant belongs to the next word

  …consonant/ + /vowel… -> …/ + /consonant+vowel…
### Vowel to Vowel linking
- In-between vowel/ + /any vowel ->  /r/

- Spread "smiley" vowel/ + /any vowel  ->  /j/

  /j/ ：yesterday, yellow, or yours

- Rounded vowel + any vowel  ->  /w/

  /w/ ： Wednesday, weather,  Wendy

## Glottal stop

-   **Glottal stop** :aka, **glottal plosive** , is a stop sound made by rapidly closing the vocal cords
-   In English, glottal stops are often used in this way to reinforce a voiceless plosive at the end of a word

### Glottalize /t/

**Glottalized /t/** is a variant of the /t/ sound between vowels and at the ends of words

-   /…vowel+t/ + /…/
-   /…l+t/ + /…/
-   /…m+t/ + /…/
-   /…n+t/ + /…/

    What did you say ? // Note the t in what
## Words Ending in “ed”
- “-ted/ded” = /Id/
- Voiceless Sound + “-ed” = /t/
- Voiced Sound + “-ed” = /d/
## Words Ending in “s”
- Voiceless Sound + “s” = /s/
- Voiced Sound + “s” = /z/
- s , z , ʃ , ʒ , ʧ , ʤ + “s” = /əz/ or /Iz/
