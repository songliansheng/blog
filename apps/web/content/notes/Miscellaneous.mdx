## Cookie、Session
When a user log in, the server create a session object with a unique ID(session ID)
- Session object (Session data) is stored on the server side, Usually,in a file or database
- Usually, session ID can be set as session variable's name
- In every request、response，the session ID is contained in the Cookie
- Data in Cookie、localStorage is accessible across all tabs(windows) of the same origin ; data stored in sessionStorage is isolated to the specific tab
- While cookies are automatically included in every request sent by the browser, data stored in localStorage or sessionStorage can be manually transmitted to the server by writing custom code
## JWT
- JWT : JSON Web Tokens , Json data+signature
- **Jwt format** :EncodedHeader.EncodedPayload.Signature
- JWTs don’t encrypt your data, they simply help you verify that it was created by someone you trust.
- **JWT token** is stored in the Authorization header using the Bearer scheme.
- The header should look like this: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`
- **JWT Claims** are information encoded in the body of a JWT ,they are information asserted about a subject
- Since the expanded form of the JWT is in a JSON format, each claim is a key in the JSON object
- **bearer token** is one usage scenario of jwt
- **Bearer tokens** can be included in an HTTP request in different ways, you could also put it into a request parameter, a cookie or the request body,the Authorization header
## Naming Convention
- **PascalCase** : aka ,UpperCamelCase , initial uppercase letter , the first letter of each appended word is capitalized
- **camelCase** :aka ,lowerCamelCase ,initial lowercase letter , the first letter of each appended word is capitalized
- **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE**
## Object-Relational DB
- Object-Relational Database : aka ,ORD
- In ORD, the basic approach is based on RDB
- Since the data in ORD is stored in a traditional database and manipulated and accessed using queries written in a query language like SQL
- ORD is considered an object store for software that is written in an object-oriented programming language
- APIs are used to store and access the data as objects in ORDBMS

## Auth - Cryptography
- Asymmetric cryptography : aka Public-key cryptography, uses pairs of keys: public key、private key
- Any person can encrypt a message using the intended receiver's public key；
- Encrypted message by puublic key can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key
- **Asymmetric cryptography** can be used to generate digital signature
- **Symmetric cryptography** : use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext
- **AES** : aka Rijndael , 
- AES algorithm has three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits
**CBC** is a common mode , base64 is the common encoding method
## Auth - Digital signature
- A digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms:

A key generation algorithm ;

A signing algorithm(aka encryption algorithm);

A signature verifying algorithm

- PKI :aka ,Public Key Infrastructure
## Auth - Claims-based identity
- Claims are pieces of information about a user that have been packaged and signed into security tokens and sent by an issuer/identity provider to relying party applications through a Security Token Service (STS)
- A claim is a statement that one subject, such as a person or organization, makes about itself or another subject
- Claims-based identity is a common method used by applications to obtain identity information about a user that another application has authenticated
- In a claims based approach to authentication, trust is explicit. Your applications believe a claim about the current user only if it trusts the entity that issued the claim

This authentication model enables users to authenticate on one domain and gain access to all other domains that trust the same identity provider
- Identity provider : aka issuer、issuing authority , is the subject making the claim or claims
- A token is a message containing claims
- SAML is a standard data format, which is used for encoding security tokens

The format of SAML encoded messages is XML
SAML also stands for protocols that use claims in SAML format
- STS (security token service) is a web service that packages claims into encrypted security tokens

For example, Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)

## Regular expression
* Wildcard  `.`matches any **single character** except \n

* `[]`Matches a **single character** that is contained within the brackets ; `[^]` matches a **single character** that is not contained within the brackets

* Boolean "or" `|`
* Grouping `()`

### Quantification

* `?` indicates zero or one occurrences of the preceding element

* `*`

* `+`
### Position
* `^` matches the **starting position** within the string
* `$` matches the ending position of the string
